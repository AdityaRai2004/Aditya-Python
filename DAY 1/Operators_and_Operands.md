# Operators and Operands

## Definition
In programming, **operators** are symbols that perform operations on **operands**. An **operand** is the value or variable on which the operator acts.

## Examples

### Arithmetic Operators
```python
x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y  # '+' is the operator, x and y are operands
print("Sum:", sum)  # Output: Sum: 15
```

### Comparison Operators
```python
x = 10
y = 5
is_greater = x > y  # '>' is the operator, x and y are operands
print("Is x greater than y?", is_greater)  # Output: True
```

### Logical Operators
```python
a = True
b = False
result = a and b  # 'and' is the operator, a and b are operands
print("Logical AND Result:", result)  # Output: False
```
