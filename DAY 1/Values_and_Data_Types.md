1. **Research:**
   - What is a value in Python?
   - Identify different data types in Python (e.g., integers, floats, strings, booleans).
2. **Fun Fact:**
   - Python is dynamically typed — you don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create one.
3. **Exercise:**
   - Write a program that:
     - Assigns different values to variables.
     - Prints the type of each variable.
